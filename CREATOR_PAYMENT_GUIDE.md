# 💳 Creator Payment Guide - TicketFlow

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

Welcome to TicketFlow! Before you create your first event, here's everything you need to know about getting paid for your ticket sales.

## 💰 How Payments Work

### Fee Structure
When someone buys a ticket to your event, here's how the money is distributed:

- **Your Earnings**: ~85-90% of ticket price
- **Platform Commission**: 5% (helps maintain TicketFlow)
- **Platform Fee**: 1% (operational costs)
- **Payment Processing**: 1.4% - 3.49% (varies by gateway)

### Example: $50 Ticket Sale
```
Ticket Price:           $50.00
Platform Commission:    -$2.50  (5%)
Platform Fee:           -$0.50  (1%)
Processing Fee:         -$1.75  (3.5% avg)
──────────────────────────────
Your Payout:            $45.25  (90.5%)
```
