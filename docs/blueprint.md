## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #237A7A (RGB). A teal color is used for the primary elements to give a fresh, modern, and inviting feel.  Since the concept evokes the natural clarity of water, teal strikes a harmonious balance of the reliable blues and energetic greens of nature.
- Background color: #F0F8FF (RGB). A very light blue provides a clean and calming backdrop, ensuring readability and focus on the content.
- Accent color: #70A4A4 (RGB). An analogous, slightly brighter teal provides interactive and secondary elements.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font for both headings and body text, to balance a modern and welcoming look.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a library like FontAwesome to represent event categories and actions.  All icons will share the same stroke weight, radius on corners, and general aesthetic, for visual consistency.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout with sufficient whitespace to avoid clutter and improve readability.  Employ responsive design to guarantee optimal viewing across various devices.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations, such as fading effects and slide-in modals, to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback without being distracting.
